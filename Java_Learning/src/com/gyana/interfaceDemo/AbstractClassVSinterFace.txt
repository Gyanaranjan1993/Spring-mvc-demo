Use abstract class when

1> You want to share the code to closely related objects.
2> You can expect classes extending the abstract class has many more common methods and uses fields
   which need to have access modifiers other than public
3> You want to declare non static and non final fields whose values can be changed using methods

Use interfaces when

1> Unrelated class may use the interface
2> You would want to provide specific data type but not concerned who is going to implement.
3> You want to take advantage of multiple inheritance.
