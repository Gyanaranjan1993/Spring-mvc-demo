/*
 * Creational Patterns:
 * 
 * Abstract Factory pattern : 
 * 
 * Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
 * 
 * Builder Pattern: 
 * 
 * Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.
 * Use builder pattern whenever the base class is same but it can have a lots of varieties.
 *

 *                 provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
 *                 but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 * 
 * 
 * Structural Pattern    :
 * 
 * Adapter Design Pattern: 
 * 
 * Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.
 * 
 * Bridge Design Pattern:
 * 
 * is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or 
 * huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.
 * 
 * Decorator : 
 *
