
Why Packages are necessary in Java:---

1. Avoid naming conflicts. 2 classes of same name can be defined in different packages
2. Making searching/locating more easy :- similar classes, methods,interfaces can be found easier
3. providing control access:  protected and default have package level access control
4. Packaging can be considered as data encapsulation.


A package is a container of a group of related classes where some of the classes 
are accessible are exposed and others are kept for internal purpose.
We can reuse existing classes from the packages as many time as we need it in our program.
