Comparable vs Comparator in java

A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object. 
The class itself must implements the java.lang.Comparable interface to compare its instances.

Using Comparator

Unlike Comparable, Comparator is external to the element type we are comparing. 
It’s a separate class. We create multiple separate classes (that implement Comparator) to compare by different members.

Collections class has a second sort() method and it takes Comparator. The sort() method invokes the compare() to sort objects.

Comparable is meant for objects with natural ordering which means the object itself must know how it is to be ordered.
For example Roll Numbers of students. 

Whereas,   Comparator interface sorting is done through a separate class.
Logically, Comparable interface compares “this” reference with the object specified and Comparator in Java compares two different class objects provided.


From stack overflow

When your class implements Comparable, the compareTo method of the class is defining the "natural" ordering of that object. 
That method is contractually obligated (though not demanded) to be in line with other methods on that object, such as a 0 should
 always be returned for objects when the .equals() comparisons return true.

A Comparator is its own definition of how to compare two objects, and can be used to compare objects in a way that might not align with the natural ordering.

For example, Strings are generally compared alphabetically. Thus the "a".compareTo("b") would use alphabetical comparisons. 
If you wanted to compare Strings on length, you would need to write a custom comparator.

In short, there isn't much difference. They are both ends to similar means. 

In general implement comparable for natural order, (natural order definition is obviously open to interpretation), and write a comparator 
for other sorting or comparison needs.
