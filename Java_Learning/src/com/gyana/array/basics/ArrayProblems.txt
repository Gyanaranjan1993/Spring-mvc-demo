Arrays are collection of objects of similar data types.

> Common array problems :

   Always index begins from zero never from 1;
   Index will start from zero and goes till length-1;

 >Array Size syntax:
 
 We can not add the array size in the left side; it is always defined during intiaizing;
 
 >String[20] str = new String[]; //this does not compile
 
 
 >int size = arr.length(); // this is not compiled as length is not a method
 >int size = arr.capacity(); //this is not compiled as array does not have capacity method;
  
 >Once array length is defined during initializing, the length can not be changed thereafter;
