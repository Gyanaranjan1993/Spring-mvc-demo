Reference vs Object vs Class vs Instance 

Lets take an example of buliding a house as the analogy

1. Class is basically a blueprint of the house. You can build as many houses you can
2. Each house you build is called an object or an instance of the class.
3. Each house we build has an address or a physical location. the address is known as reference.
4. There can be two references to the same object.
