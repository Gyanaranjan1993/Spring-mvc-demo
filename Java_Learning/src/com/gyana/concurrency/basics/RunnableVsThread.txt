Runnable or Thread?
Simply put, we generally encourage the use of Runnable over Thread:

When extending the Thread class, we're not overriding any of its methods. Instead, we override the method of Runnable (which Thread happens to implement). This is a clear violation of IS-A Thread principle
Creating an implementation of Runnable and passing it to the Thread class utilizes composition and not inheritance – which is more flexible
After extending the Thread class, we can't extend any other class
From Java 8 onwards, Runnables can be represented as lambda expressions
