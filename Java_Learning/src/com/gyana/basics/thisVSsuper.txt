this () vs super()

1. this() is used to call a constructor from another overloaded constructor, in the same class.
2. it should be the first statement in the overloaded constructor

1.super() is used to call the parent class constructor from the child constructor.
2.java compiler automatically inserts the super() in the beginning of the child constructor if its not mentioned
3.super() should be the very first statement in the child constructor if mentioned explicitly.
